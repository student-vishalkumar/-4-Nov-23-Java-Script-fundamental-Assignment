Importance pf meaningful and discriptive variable anme is javascript-> 

Descriptive variable names really make reading code a lot easier. But the reality is that some variables are hard to describe accurately. In general, you want to be descriptive, but keep your variable names from about 8 to 20 characters.

Example -

const firstName = "Vishal";
const middleName = "Kumar";
const lastName = "Rajput";

console.log(firstName + ' ' + middleName + ' ' + lastName);

output -> Vishal Kumar Rajput
