Five primitive datatypes in javascript:

5) Undefined.

1) String - The string data type in JavaScript represents a sequence of characters that are surrounded by single or double quotes.

syntax-> let Str = "Name";

2)Number - Number data type in javascript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.

syntax-> const x = 14;

3)Null - This data type can hold only one possible value that is null.

syntax-> let x = null;

4)Boolean - The boolean data type can accept only two values i.e. true and false.

syntax-> let isLoggedIn = false;

5)Undefined - The meaning of undefined is ‘value is not assigned’.
